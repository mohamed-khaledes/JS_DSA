/*
What is Data Structure?
A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and
organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and
effectively. The main idea behind using data structures is to 
minimize the time and space complexities. An efficient data structure
takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.

>> DataSturctures Types
-- Built in data structures
    > Arrays
    > Objects
    > Sets
    > Maps

-- Custom data sturctures
    > Stacks
    > Queues
    > Circular queues
    > Linked Lists
    > Hash tables
    > Trees
    > Graphs

> We will use Built in data structures to build Custom data sturctures
